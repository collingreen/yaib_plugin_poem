A poem plugin for [yaib](https://github.com/collingreen/yaib) to allow
submitting and displaying simple haiku and limericks (actually just 3 and 5
line poems -- this plugin currently does no validation of content).

When submitting a poem, yaib will PM the author a deletion key that they can use
to remove the poem immediately (in case of errors). Additionally, admins have
access to the `!recentpoems` command, which provides deletion keys for
moderation purposes.
